			<p> The javascipt is loaded, parsed and executed.<br>
			    When loading multiple scripts you need to load your dependencies first.<br>
			    Javascript blocks all other browser actions so best to load it at the very ened of the page<br>
			    When you do that your scripts can reference any HTML in the page and make any changes<br>

            <p> The Three layers of Web Developement:<br>
                First you have your content layer written in HTML<br>
                Second layer is CSS but not all browsers have the same level of CSS support<br>
                Finally, JavaScript is the third layer which implements functionality. It can be disabled<br>
            </p>
			<p> Use Progressive Enhancement<br>
			 	Make your site work in HTML first<br>
			 	Then add CSS and code IF the browser supports a particular feature<br>
			 </p>
			 
			 <p> Avoid Javascript when any other technology could be used instead<br>
			     CSS3 has a wide range of effects. They are often more impressive, use<br>
			     less code, are easier to write, and run far faster than any javascript equivalent<br>
			     HTML5 can handle client side form validation<br>
			     HTML5 or Javascript client side form validation is never a substitute for server side validation<br>
			 </p>
            <p> Parameters<br>
                a = a "" ""; means a will equate to a if it's truthy (not null, undefined, 0, or an empty string)<br>
                If it is any of those a will be set to an empty string<br>
                There is a special variable names 'arguments' which hols all the values you pass to the function (an array)<br>
