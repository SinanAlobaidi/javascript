			<p> The javascript is loaded, parsed and executed.<br>
			    When loading multiple scripts you need to load your dependencies first.<br>
			    Javascript blocks all other browser actions so best to load it at the very ened of the page<br>
			    When you do that your scripts can reference any HTML in the page and make any changes<br>
			</p>
            <p> The Three layers of Web Developement:<br>
                First you have your content layer written in HTML<br>
                Second layer is CSS but not all browsers have the same level of CSS support<br>
                Finally, JavaScript is the third layer which implements functionality. It can be disabled<br>
            </p>
			<p> Use Progressive Enhancement<br>
			 	Make your site work in HTML first<br>
			 	Then add CSS and code IF the browser supports a particular feature<br>
			 </p>
			 
			 <p> Avoid Javascript when any other technology could be used instead<br>
			     CSS3 has a wide range of effects. They are often more impressive, use<br>
			     less code, are easier to write, and run far faster than any javascript equivalent<br>
			     HTML5 can handle client side form validation<br>
			     HTML5 or Javascript client side form validation is never a substitute for server side validation<br>

            <p> Parameters<br>
                a = a "" ""; means a will equate to a if it's truthy (not null, undefined, 0, or an empty string)<br>
                If it is any of those a will be set to an empty string<br>
                There is a special variable names 'arguments' which hols all the values you pass to the function (an array)<br>
            </p>
            <p>
                Everything in Javascript is an object (or it behaves like one)<br>
                An object is simply an instance of the Base object type.<br>
                You can still create class-like object templates<b>
                YOu can still use techniques such as inheritance<br>
                You can also create single objects without a template<br>
                You can extend individual objects without affecting others<br>
                You can extend every instance of an object<br>

                Browser APIS: The good news
                Most APIS are consistent across browsrs<br>
                APIs are usually documented by the W3C<br>
                JavaScript shims can help when necessary<br>
            </p>

                Browser APIs: The bad news<br>
                Browsers are at different levels of implementation<br>
                Newer APIs are subject to change and can evolve<br>
                Older versions of Internet Explorer remain popular<br>
            </p>

                Browser Specific Issues - don't use browser sniffing<br>
                All browsers identify themselves with a User Agent String<br>
                Browser parsing is difficult<br>
                There are many browsers and versions<br>
                Scalability is decreases, maintenance is increased<br>
                Use feature detection(i.e. XMLHTTPRequest<br>
                var xhr = window.XMLHttpRequest ? new XMLHttpRequest() : new ActivieXObject("Microsoft.XMLHTTP");
